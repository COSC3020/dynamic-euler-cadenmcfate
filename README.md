# Dynamic Programming Euler's Number

The mathematical constant $e$ (Euler's number) is defined as follows:

$$ e = \sum^{\infty}_{i=0} \frac{1}{i!} = \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1} +
\frac{1}{1\cdot 2} + \frac{1}{1\cdot 2\cdot 3} + \frac{1}{1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot
4} + \ldots$$

I've provided an implementation of a function to approximate $e$ up to a number
of $n$ terms in `code.js` for you. However, it does repeated work -- identify
where the repeated work occurs and avoid it through bottom-up dynamic
programming (not memoization). Change the implementation accordingly.

Test your new functions; I've provided some basic testing code in `code.test.js`
but you need to go beyond that.

## Runtime Analysis

What is the worst-case big $\Theta$ time complexity of your algorithm?

## Answer

This algorithm consists of a while loop with $n$ complexity that carries out operations of constant time to find the summation approximation of $e$. Therefore, the worst-case time complexity of the entire algorithm is $\Theta(n)$. This algorithm does less work than the previous because there is no repetition of work in finding the factorial denominator terms. Instead of calculating factorial(i) for all $i\in [1,n]$, which entails plenty of repetitive calculations, we start with a denominator of 1 and build it up from there; we only calculate factorial(n) once.
